    </ul></p>
    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <p>putting patients first and treating everyone with dignity and respect.</p>
    <p>Medcare is a comprehensive healthcare network featuring two hospitals, two urgent cares, an emergent care center, outpatient services and a provider network within Nairobi and beyond.</p>
    <p>We believe that caring can't be taught, kindness isn't a subject learned in medical school, and compassion doesn't come with a degree; these intrinsic qualities are deeply rooted in our culture, which can be seen, heard, and felt throughout our system. We're big enough to provide exceptional care, yet small enough to keep it personalized; we provide healthcare that actually cares.</p>
